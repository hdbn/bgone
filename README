-- Description

This package contains implementations of linear time algorithms computing
the Lempel Ziv(LZ77) factorization (also known as LZ77 parsing) from the paper

http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.1448

Implemented algorithms:

  BGone  - uses 5n bytes of space (assuming 32-bit integers and byte alphabet),
          This is the most space efficient algorithm.
  BGtwo  - uses 9n bytes of space. 

Given space requirements include the input text of n bytes but exclude the
output factorization.
